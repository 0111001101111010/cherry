# Cherry

An extensible hub for home automation/Internet of Things.

## Overview

Cherry acts as a hub for your house and allows any connected component to communicate with each other. Cherry's power comes from its plugin system. Connected devices talk to each other through the _firehose_, a message bus provided by Cherry. Adding a new component to the system is as simple as writing a few lines of code (Node.js module or ClojureScript namespace).

As an example, a Philips Hue plugin could wait for "to:lights" messages on the firehose and flip the lights in response. A GPIO plugin could send "from:pin" messages when a button is pressed on the Raspberry Pi. Finally, another plugin could read "from:pin" messages and turns them into "to:lights" messages. Boum, lights turn on and off when a button is pressed. This is easily expressed in code:

```javascript
module.exports = function (ec) {
  console.log("lightswitch ready to rock");

  ec.consume(function (msg) {
    console.log("lightswitch received", require('util').inspect(msg));
    switch (msg.from) {
      case "pin":
        if (msg.body === "low") {
          ec.produce({to: "lights", body: {on: true}});
        } else if (msg.body === "high") {
          ec.produce({to: "lights", body: {on: false}});
        }
        break;
    };
  });
}
```

## Using

```bash
lein do cljsbuild clean, cljsbuild once
cp config.json.sample config.json
node dist/cherry.js
```

## Building

```bash
lein do cljsbuild clean, cljsbuild once
node dist/cherry.js
```

## Creating a plugin

We've focused on making it really simple and easy to write a plugin for Cherry.

## Built-in plugins

You can configure plugins through a `config.json` file.
